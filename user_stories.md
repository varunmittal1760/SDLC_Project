# Feature: Event Scheduling

**User Story 1: The Organizer**
As a Garden Manager,
I want to create a new event, specify the date, time, a clear title like "Weekend Weeding & Composting", and add a description of the required tasks and tools,
so that I can efficiently organize workdays and ensure all members know what to expect and how to contribute.

**User Story 2: The Participant**
As a Garden Member,
I want to view a list of all upcoming garden events and be able to RSVP with a single tap,
so that I can quickly see what's happening, confirm my attendance to help the manager plan, and feel more connected to the community's activities.

**User Story 3: The Committed but Busy Member**
As a busy Garden Member who has RSVP'd 'Yes',
I want to receive an automatic push notification reminder on my phone the day before the event, so that I don't forget my commitment amidst a busy schedule and can show up on time and prepared.
